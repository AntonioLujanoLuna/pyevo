# PyEvo Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the PyEvo package based on the code review feedback.

## Utility Organization

**Issue:** The utilities were split between `pyevo/utils.py` and a separate `utils/` directory, causing confusion.

**Solution:**
- Created a structured `pyevo/utils/` package with specialized modules:
  - `acceleration.py`: GPU and parallel processing utilities
  - `image.py`: Image processing functions with optional SciPy integration
  - `interactive.py`: Interactive optimization control
  - `constants.py`: Global constants

This organization maintains a clear separation of concerns while keeping all utilities within the main package.

## Import Patterns

**Issue:** The code sometimes tried importing from the installed package first, then fell back to local imports by manipulating sys.path, which can be confusing for contributors.

**Solution:**
- Maintained the fallback pattern for examples to ensure they work both when installed and in development
- Updated the import statements to use the new package structure
- Improved consistency across the codebase
- Added development dependencies in setup.py to encourage proper installation with `pip install -e .`

## Custom Image Processing Functions

**Issue:** Custom SSIM and convolution functions were implemented instead of using optimized libraries like SciPy.

**Solution:**
- Kept the custom implementations for zero-dependency scenarios
- Added optional SciPy/scikit-image integration with automatic detection
- Created a `get_optimal_image_functions()` helper to automatically select the best available implementation
- Added proper dependencies in setup.py under the "image" extra

## GPU Resource Management

**Issue:** The CuPy implementation could benefit from more explicit memory management, especially for large-scale optimization tasks.

**Solution:**
- Added explicit memory management functions:
  - `get_gpu_memory_info()`: Get current GPU memory usage
  - `clear_gpu_memory()`: Explicitly free all unused GPU memory
  - Memory-aware batch sizing that adjusts based on available GPU memory
  - Added cleanup in try/finally blocks to ensure proper memory release
- Enhanced the `batch_process()` function to manage memory better during processing
- Added memory usage tracking to `optimize_with_acceleration()`

## Checkpointing System

**Issue:** The checkpointing system saved optimizer state but session information separately, potentially leading to synchronization issues.

**Solution:**
- Created a unified checkpointing approach in `acceleration.py`:
  - `save_checkpoint()`: Save optimizer state and session info in a single file
  - `load_checkpoint()`: Load both from a single file
- Enhanced the `InteractiveOptimizer` to use this unified system
- Added automatic checkpointing to `optimize_with_acceleration()`
- Improved error handling during saving/loading

## Test Coverage

**Issue:** Tests focused on core functionality but could be expanded to cover GPU acceleration, parallel processing, and edge cases.

**Solution:**
- Added a new test file `tests/test_acceleration.py` that covers:
  - GPU detection and memory management
  - Array transfers between CPU and GPU
  - Batch processing on both CPU and GPU
  - Parallel evaluation with different worker counts
  - Full optimization with different acceleration methods
  - Tests that gracefully handle the absence of GPU

## New Features and Improvements

- **Enhanced CMA-ES Implementation**: Added proper evolution path updates and covariance matrix adaptation
- **Generalized Interactive Optimizer**: Made it work with all optimizer types, not just SNES
- **Unified API**: Consistent interface across all utilities and optimizers
- **Improved Examples**: Added an advanced example demonstrating the new features
- **Better Documentation**: Added docstrings and comments throughout the codebase
- **Expanded Dependencies**: Added optional dependencies for different use cases
- **Development Tools**: Added testing and development tools as optional dependencies

## Using the Improvements

### Standard Import Pattern

```python
from pyevo import (
    # Optimizers
    SNES, CMA_ES, PSO,
    
    # Acceleration
    optimize_with_acceleration, is_gpu_available,
    
    # Image processing
    calculate_ssim, get_optimal_image_functions,
    
    # Interactive mode
    InteractiveOptimizer
)
```

### GPU Acceleration

```python
# Check if GPU is available
if is_gpu_available():
    # Run with GPU acceleration
    best_solution, best_fitness, stats = optimize_with_acceleration(
        optimizer=optimizer,
        fitness_func=my_function,
        max_iterations=100,
        use_gpu=True  # Enable GPU
    )
```

### Image Processing with Optimal Implementation

```python
# Get the best available implementations
ssim_func, conv_func = get_optimal_image_functions()

# Use them for processing
similarity = ssim_func(image1, image2)
```

### Unified Checkpointing

```python
# Save optimizer state and session info
save_checkpoint(optimizer, session_info, "checkpoint.npz")

# Load both from a single file
optimizer_state, session_info = load_checkpoint("checkpoint.npz")
```

These improvements make the PyEvo package more organized, efficient, and user-friendly while maintaining compatibility with existing code.
